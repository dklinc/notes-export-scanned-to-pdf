I have been scanning documents into Notes for years and have decided that it would be better to have them saved
as PDFs in the file system instead. Files on iOS now enables scanning documents directly into it, so there is 
really no reason to keep this in notes, which routinely messes up file names.

I needed a script to do this as I had a ton of scanned documents. I found a script online, which I adapted to
work with today's version of Notes and my purpose. The script is very fragile and needs to be tested with
every new version of Notes. See script notes for more details.

My workflow when I used it was as follows:

1. Find a folder in Notes that contains scanned documents I want to convert to PDFs
2. Make sure folder only contains notes with a scanned document. If it contains other stuff, delete it
temporarily and then return it when done converting to PDF.
3. Select the desired folder. And hide the folders in Notes (Cmd-Opt-s).
4. Make sure no other Notes windows are open.
4. Open script in Script Editor.
5. Click Run.
